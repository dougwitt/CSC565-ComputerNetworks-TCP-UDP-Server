## **Files Submitted**

**1. TCPClient.cpp:** Implements the TCP client that sends loan calculation requests to the TCP server.  
**2. TCPServer.cpp:** Implements the TCP server that calculates loan payments and responds to the TCP client.  
**3. UDPClient.cpp:** Implements the UDP client for sending loan calculation requests to the UDP server.  
**4. UDPServer.cpp:** Implements the UDP server for calculating loan payments and responding to UDP client requests.  

## **Compilation and Running Instructions**

### **TCP**

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC). Follow these instructions to compile and run the TCP and UDP versions of the client and server programs.  

#### **TCP Server**

##### **Compiling the TCP Server**
To compile and run the TCP Server, enter the following command:

```
g++ TCPServer.cpp -o TCPServer
./TCPServer
```

#### **TCP Client**

##### **Compiling and running the TCP Client**

To compile and run the TCPClient, enter the following command (replace placeholder values with actual loan details):

```
g++ TCPClient.cpp -o Cal
./Cal <server_address> <loan_amount> <term_years> <interest_rate>
```

### U**DP**

#### **UDP Versions**

#### **Compiling and running UDP Server**

```
g++ UDPServer.cpp -o UDPServer
./UDPServer
```

#### **Compiling and running UDP Client**

```
g++ UDPClient.cpp -o UDPClient
./UDPClient <server_address> <loan_amount> <term_years> <interest_rate>
```

##### **Application Protocol Description**

The client communicates with the server using a simple text-based protocol:

* Request Format: The client sends a request in the format: <loan_amount> <term_years> <interest_rate>.

* Response Format: The server responds with: Monthly Payment: $<monthly_payment>, Total Payment: $<total_payment>.

#### **TCP Communication**

* The UDP versions send and receive messages in a connectionless manner. 

##### **Known Bugs and Limitations**
* The server does not validate input formats; incorrect formats may lead to undefined behavior.  
* UDP implementations lack packet loss handling or retries.  
* The server is not designed for concurrency and handles one request at a time.  

##### **Additional Notes**
This project demonstrates basic socket programming skills for TCP and UDP communications in a client-server architecture, highlighting fundamental network programming concepts.
